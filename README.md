This repository contains files relevant for the research conducted in a thesis for the degree Master of Engineering (Mechatronic) at University of Wollongong. This repository contains the package used on a virtual computer running Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic. This package is used both in a simulated environment using Gazebo (files for this are available in this package), and for the Turtlebot3 Waffle where modified code for implementation with ultrasonic sensor can be found at https://github.com/OleIdole/master_thesis_tb3.
